      <p>Sub-metering can be a powerful tool for fair utility billing and promoting energy conservation, but it's crucial for landlords to understand and comply with local and state regulations. Laws vary significantly, covering aspects like tenant notification, billing practices, and approved meter types.</p>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Key Considerations:</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
        <li><strong>Tenant Consent and Notification:</strong> Many jurisdictions require landlords to inform tenants about sub-metering implementation and may require consent.</li>
        <li><strong>Billing Accuracy:</strong> Regulations often stipulate how charges must be calculated and presented to tenants, ensuring transparency.</li>
        <li><strong>Approved Equipment:</strong> Some areas may have standards for the types of sub-meters that can be installed.</li>
        <li><strong>Dispute Resolution:</strong> Understand the processes for handling billing disputes.</li>

      <p>Managing energy costs in multi-family properties can be challenging. Here are five actionable tips to help you and your tenants save energy:</p>
      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 mt-4">
        <li><strong>Install Smart Thermostats:</strong> Allow for precise temperature control and scheduling, reducing wasted heating and cooling.</li>
        <li><strong>Upgrade to LED Lighting:</strong> LEDs consume significantly less energy and last much longer than traditional bulbs.</li>
        <li><strong>Promote Water Conservation:</strong> Install low-flow fixtures and educate tenants on water-saving habits, as water heating is a major energy consumer.</li>
        <li><strong>Improve Insulation and Weather Stripping:</strong> Reduce drafts and heat loss, making HVAC systems more efficient.</li>
        <li><strong>Implement Sub-Metering:</strong> When tenants are responsible for their own usage, they are more likely to conserve energy. Tari Smart Power can help!</li>
